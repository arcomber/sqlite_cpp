other tests we need:
1. no row in table matches where clause - correctly returns zero results
2. database filename does not exist - no results and no crash
3. how can we do a performance test?  eg load a load of rows in a loop and check time taken
4. // TODO - test where where_clause = "" - crashes - find out why and how to prevent
5. setup gtest to run on linux - how to do that?
6. gow to do the range dates thing using this?
7. how to do a join - like we need using this?
